A Pytest plugin for reducing failure detection time of your Python test suite with automated test prioritization/ranking.

This [pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest) plugin allows you to find failures faster and receive sooner debugging feedback from CI. It speed up the failure detection of your test suite by prioritizing the execution of tests that are faster, recently failed and/or more textually related to code change.

## Installation

To install `pytest-ranking` via [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project):

```bash
pip install pytest-ranking
```


## Usage

Pytest will automatically find the plugin and use it when you run ``pytest``. You can use the default prioritization heuristic, which runs tests that have shorter execution time first by passing the ``--rank`` option:

```bash
pytest --rank
```

The terminal output will tell you the current configurations and runtime overhead of this plugin. For example:

 ```text
[pytest-ranking] Weights: 1-1-0
[pytest-ranking] History length: 30
[pytest-ranking] Number of files with new hashes: 0
[pytest-ranking] Change relatedness computation time (s): 0.0007872581481933594
[pytest-ranking] Test order computation time(s): 0.00020933151245117188
```

You can configure the weights of different prioritization heuristics by passing the optional `--rank-weight` flag with formatted values:

```bash
pytest --rank --rank-weight=0-1-0
```

Weights are separated by hyphens ``-``. The 1st weight is for running faster tests, the 2nd weight is for running recently failed tests, and the 3rd weight is for running tests more textually similar to the changed `*.py` files in the codebase since the last run.
All weights must be integers or floats, and their sum will be normalized to 1.
A higher weight means that a corresponding heuristic is favored. The default value is ``1-0-0``, only prioritizes faster tests.


You can also configure the maximum window size for looking into previous test runs, which is used to compute the number of runs since a test had failed, by passing the optional `--rank-hist-len` flag (the default value is 50):

```bash
pytest --rank --rank-hist-len=30
```


You can always apply these options by adding them to the ``addopts`` setting in your [pytest.ini](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference/customize.html#configuration).

For example, create `pytest.ini` in the codebase root folder as such:
```ini
[pytest]
addopts = --rank --rank-weight=0-1-0 --rank-hist-len=30
```
and run `pytest` on command line.

Alternatively, you can also create `pytest.ini` in the codebase root folder as such:
```ini
[pytest]
rank-weight=0-1-0
rank-hist-len=30
```

and run `pytest --rank` on command line.


### Warning

Because `pytest-ranking` re-orders tests to speed up failure detection time, please disable other pytest plugins that enforeces other test orders, e.g., [pytest-randomly](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-randomly), [pytest-random-order](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-random-order), [pytest-reverse](https://github.com/adamchainz/pytest-reverse).
